### Me?

### I'm from The North of England, originally born in Liverpool I've lived in Sheffield, Aberystwyth, Amsterdam, Milan and finally settled in London.

### I used to be a microbiologist but part way through my PhD I became so interested in the graphics packages I was using to do my presentations to my bioengineering department I decided to change careers and signed up for a career in Computing with an MSc in Applied Computing Technology. I finished that and became a programme, picking up [a coding job](http://www.blackmoonproject.co.uk/interviews/steve_hayes.php) in Camden, North West London. I dropped the full time coding and got into project management and managed teams. These days I am moving back into coding. It's at lot easier these days, especially with languages like Python and tools like VSC and markdown. Suddenly, instead of having to deal with the spaghetti soup of perl, coding is fun again. 

### Having worked in Media and the games industy, I've got lots of face-paced, mission critical product consumer delivery experience.

### Built with Python, my new love!
